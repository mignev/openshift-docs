== Scaling {product-title} HAProxy Router

The {product-title}
xref:../install_config/router/index.adoc#install-config-router-overview[router]
is the ingress point for all external traffic destined for {product-title}
services.

On an public cloud instance of size 4 vCPU/16GB RAM, a single HAProxy router is able to handle
between 7000-32000 HTTP keep-alive requests depending on encryption, page size,
and the number of connections used. For example, when using TLS
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#edge-termination[edge] or
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#re-encryption-termination[re-encryption]
terminations with large page sizes and a high numbers of connections, expect to
see results in the lower range. With HTTP keep-alive, a single HAProxy router is
capable of saturating 1 Gbit NIC at page sizes as small as 8 kB.

The table below shows HTTP keep-alive performance on such a public cloud
instance with a single HAProxy and 100 routes:

[cols="2,3,3",options="header"]
|===
|*Encryption* |*Page size* |*HTTP(s) requests per second*
|none |1kB |15435
|none |4kB |11947
|edge |1kB |7467
|edge |4kB |7678
|passthrough |1kB |25789
|passthrough |4kB |17876
|re-encrypt |1kB |7611
|re-encrypt |4kB |7395

|===

When running on bare metal with modern processors, you can expect roughly
twice the performance of the public cloud instance above. This
overhead is introduced by the virtualization layer in place on public clouds and
holds mostly true for private cloud-based virtualization as well. The following
table is a guide on how many applications to use behind the router:

[cols="2,4",options="header"]
|===
|*Number of applications* |*Application type*
|5-10 |static file/web server or caching proxy
|100-1000 |applications generating dynamic content

|===

In general, HAProxy can saturate about 5-1000 applications, depending on the
technology in use. The number will typically be lower for applications serving
only static content.

xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#router-sharding[Router sharding]
should be used to serve more routes towards applications and help horizontally
scale the routing tier.

[[scaling-performance-network-performance]]
== Optimizing Network Performance

The xref:../architecture/additional_concepts.adoc#openshift-sdn[OpenShift SDN]
uses OpenvSwitch, virtual extensible LAN (VXLAN) tunnels, OpenFlow rules, and
iptables. This network can be tuned by using jumbo frames, network interface
cards (NIC) offloads, multi-queue, and ethtool settings.

VXLAN provides benefits over VLANs, such as an increase in networks from 4096 to
over 16 million, and layer 2 connectivity across physical networks. This allows
for all pods behind a service to communicate with each other, even if they are
running on different systems.

VXLAN encapsulates all tunneled traffic in user datagram protocol (UDP) packets.
However, this leads to increased CPU utilization. Both these outer- and
inner-packets are subject to normal checksumming rules to guarantee data has not
been corrupted during transit. Depending on CPU performance, this additional
processing overhead can cause a reduction in throughput and increased latency
when compared to traditional, non-overlay networks.

Cloud, VM, and bare metal CPU performance can be capable of handling much more
than one Gbps network throughput. When using higher bandwidth links such as 10
or 40 Gbps, reduced performance can occur. This is a known issue in VXLAN-based
environments and is not specific to containers or {product-title}. Any network
that relies on VXLAN tunnels will perform similarly because of the VXLAN
implementation.

If you are looking to push beyond one Gbps, you can:

* Use
xref:../install_config/configuring_routing.adoc#install-config-configuring-native-container-routing[Native
Container Routing]. This option has important operational caveats that do not
exist when using OpenShift SDN, such as updating routing tables on a router.
* Evaluate network plug-ins that implement different routing techniques, such as
border gateway protocol (BGP).
* Use VXLAN-offload capable network adapters. VXLAN-offload moves the packet
checksum calculation and associated CPU overhead off of the system CPU and onto
dedicated hardware on the network adapter. This frees up CPU cycles for use by
pods and applications, and allows users to utilize the full bandwidth of their
network infrastructure.

VXLAN-offload does not reduce latency. However, CPU utilization is reduced even
in latency tests.

[[scaling-performance-network-subnetting]]
== Configuring Network Subnets

{product-title} provides IP address management for both pods and services. The
default values allow for:

- A maximum cluster size of 1024 nodes
- Each of the 1024 nodes having a /23 allocated to it (510 usable IPs for pods)
- Around 65,536 IP addresses for services

Under most circumstances, these networks cannot be changed after deployment.
So, planning ahead for growth is important.

Restrictions for resizing networks are document in the
xref:../install_config/configuring_sdn.adoc#configuring-the-pod-network-on-masters[Configuring
SDN documentation].

To plan for a larger environment, the following are suggested values to consider
adding to the `[OSE3:vars]` section in your Ansible inventory file:

----
[OSE3:vars]
osm_cluster_network_cidr=10.128.0.0/10
----

This will allow for 8192 nodes, each with 510 usable IPs.

Please refer to the supportability limits in the {product-title} documentation
for node/pod limits for the version of software you are installing.
