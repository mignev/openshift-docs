Controller Role Verification

Module included in the following assemblies:

The {product-title} controller service,
`atomic-openshift-master-controllers.service`, is available across all master
hosts. The service runs in active/passive mode, meaning it should only be
running on one master at any time.

The {product-title} controllers execute a procedure to choose which host runs
the service. The current running value is stored in the `etcd` cluster within the `/openshift.io/leases/controllers` key.

Verification of the master host actively running the
`atomic-openshift-master-controllers.service` service is performed by running
the following command on any of the master nodes:

----
# etcdctl2 get /openshift.io/leases/controllers
master-0fz9x9k2
----

The command outputs an identifier of the master host running the controller
service, but currently this identifier is generated randomly when the service is
executed. Unfortunately, there is no way to get the ID of every master except
searching in the `atomic-openshift-master-controllers.service` logs where it
logs its own ID:

----
I1130 11:40:56.778373   30138 leaderelection.go:127] Attempting to acquire controller lease as master-*8sn5gpzn*, renewing every 30s
----

In order to find the identifiers of the master nodes, log in to each master node
and run:

----
$ journalctl -b -u atomic-openshift-master-controllers.service --output cat | grep 'Attempting to acquire controller lease as' | tail -1 | sed 's/.*lease as \(.*\),.*/\1/'
master-0fz9x9k2
